# LuminOS

LuminOS is a simple Arch-based Linux distribution. Also serves as a bachelor's thesis project.

## What is and what LuminOS is not

### What is LuminOS

- A newb's project for a bachelor's thesis - I'm not a Linux expert, so I'm learning as I go
- Potentially being long-term supported - I'm planning for it to be my perfect distribution, and have plans in the future to start writing my own packages for it

### What LuminOS is not

- Perfect distribution for everyone - It's based around my needs and preferences, with me liking keyboard based workflows and minimalism
- Jack of all trades type of distribution - It's meant to do one thing and do it well
- A Wayland project - I hate Nvidia :(
